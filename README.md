Welcome to my Personal website: [https://victorotazu.github.io/](https://victorotazu.github.io/)

How I made it:
- [Jekyll] (https://jekyllrb.com/)
- Github Pages
- [Jalpc Theme](https://github.com/jarrekk/Jalpc) (Check it out for more instructions).


How to switch themes:
- [Daniel Pelsmaeker](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31327045/switch-theme-in-an-existing-jekyll-installation) wrote a great guide to switch themes on an existing jekyll installation. The only thing that his answer doesn't include is that you'll have to add `--allow-unrelated-histories` when merging the orphan branch with `master`.
- Comment out `baseurl` in the `_config.yml` file. Check my `_config` as a reference.

How to customize the style:
- Just update the `_style.scss` file under the `_sass` folder.


Check out the [Jalpc Theme](https://github.com/jarrekk/Jalpc). It's a great theme, fully customizable and has all the instructions
on how to get started.
